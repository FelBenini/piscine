# 42 C Piscine

The **42 Piscine** is a 26 days process that tests candidates on their ability to learn quickly, work collaboratively, and persist through increasingly difficult programming challenges. The C Piscine covers various topics like basic C syntax, pointers, memory allocation, recursion, shell and Makefiles, data manipulation and much more!

ðŸ“Œ **Note** - These solutions are shared for **educational purposes** only. If you're currently participating in the Piscine, I highly encourage you to try solving the exercises on your own before referring to others' code.
